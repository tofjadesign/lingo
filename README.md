It works fine without any libaries, but the are some issues to be solved.
Such as i want the guessed word under the other attempts and above "congratulations".
Even if there is a hint color for a letter, the script does not know whether the letter appears one or more times.
Also the css is not optimized and is not yet responsive for all devices, but thats not realy a proplem that I cant fix.
